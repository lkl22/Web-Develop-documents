#### Local Installation

To install the latest release or a specific version, run one of the following commands:

```
npm install --save-dev webpack
npm install --save-dev webpack@<version>
```

If you're using webpack v4 or later, you'll need to install a [CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/).

```
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli or
npm install --save-dev webpack-command
```

#### Global Installation

> ```
> npm install --global webpack
> ```
